This project was built by 3 students during 2022-2023 majoring in Business Information Technology at ZHAW. 
The goal of this project was to simulate where charging stations can be placed in switzerland based of working population and building zones of each community in Switzerland (about 2100) using a K-Means as clustering algorithm.

We have developed 3 scenarios based on a literature review: 

1. High distribution of charging stations across Switzerland (about 500'000)
2. Medium distribution (300'000)
3. Low distribution (150'000)

After using the centroids from K-Means as potential place of a charging station we used QGIS 3.6 to map the points to the nearest street. 

Goal of this project was scientific paper. 

NOTE: 

All the datasets and results are available online and can be found on Google Drive
